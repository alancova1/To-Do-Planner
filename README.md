# To-Do-Planner
Author: Alan Covarrubias
The goal of this project is to create a simple console based To-Do Planner where the user can add, view, and delete tasks, so if you need to write down a task you have to complete by the end of the day you can add it here to remember it for later in the day. This project will demonstrate your understanding of classes, and vectors.
